# CMOS SRAM based on 0.18 um technology
6T SRAM is a type of static random-access commonly used in modern integrated circuits for storing data.It gets its name from its basic storage cell, which consists of six transistors. These six transistors are arranged in a way that allows them to store a single binary but of data.
