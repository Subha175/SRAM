# CMOS SRAM based on 0.18 um technology
6T SRAM is a type of static random-access commonly used in modern integrated circuits for storing data.It gets its name from its basic storage cell, which consists of six transistors. These six transistors are arranged in a way that allows them to store a single binary but of data.

- [Pre-Charge Circuit](#section-1)
    - [The pre-charge circuit is responsible for setting the bitlines (BL and BLB) to a stable state before reading or writing data. In the pre-charge phase, both bitlines are set to a logic high or low level, depending on the SRAM cell's design.](#subsection-1-1)

- [Sense Amplifier](#section-1)
     - [In SRAM cells, sense amplifiers are used to amplify and sense the small voltage difference between the bitlines (BL and BLB) during read operations. Sense amplifiers play a vital role in determining the stored data within the SRAM cell.](#subsection-1-2)

- [Row Decoder](#section-1)
     - [A row decoder in SRAM is responsible for selecting and activating the wordline associated with a specific row of memory cells, allowing read and write operations to be performed on that row. The efficient operation of the row decoder is essential for the overall performance and power efficiency of the SRAM memory.](#subsection-1-2)
